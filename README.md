# C64_FG4YMC_Assembly
Converting the program in the book:  Fantasy Games For Your Micro Computer to 64 Assembly in the CBP prg Studio

The main purpose of this is to have a comparable program between basic and assembly for the commodore 64, and one
where the assembly is explianed in another place, to help people (mostly myself) learn.
